# Binary-Tree-Visualizer

Binary Tree Visualizer 🌳
This project is a real-time binary tree visualizer built with Python and Pygame. It allows users to insert and delete nodes dynamically while visualizing the structure of the binary tree. The tree structure updates instantly, showing both nodes and edges with a clean and interactive interface.

Features
🌟 Interactive Input: Add (I) or delete (D) nodes dynamically using your keyboard.
🔍 Real-time Visualization: The binary tree is displayed graphically, with nodes as circles and edges connecting parent and child nodes.
🧹 Dynamic Updates: Tree structure is recalculated and redrawn immediately after any modification.
🔤 Keyboard Support: Use keyboard input to manage the tree seamlessly without freezing the interface.
How It Works
Launch the visualizer, and the initial tree is displayed.
Press:
I to enter insert mode. Type a numeric value and press Enter to add the value to the tree.
D to enter delete mode. Type a numeric value and press Enter to remove it from the tree.
Watch as the tree structure updates instantly!
